# Regional and Specialty-Based Medical Inequality Analysis  
**BADA 6th Cohort – Team: Kim Jio, Park Sabin, Lee Yeungbin, Oh Seungjoo, Hong Sunghyuk**

This project identifies regional and specialty-based disparities in medical services across South Korea. Using a data-driven dashboard, we propose targeted policy recommendations to improve healthcare accessibility and balance the distribution of medical professionals.

- Increasing healthcare service gaps due to regional and specialty-based workforce imbalance
- Urgent need to address underserved areas and improve public access to medical services

## 3. Methodology and Indicators

### Indicators Used

**Healthcare Accessibility Indicators:**
- Physicians per 100,000 people  
- Hospitals per 100,000 people  
- Beds per 100,000 people  
- Unmet medical needs rate

**Specialty Imbalance Indicators:**
- Ratio of essential specialties (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, OB/GYN) based on ideal 38% target

### Dashboard Features

- Region selection by city/province
- Comparative metrics (national and intra-provincial)
- Bar charts for population characteristics
- Pie charts showing specialty imbalances

## 4. Key Findings

### Underserved Areas

- **Jangsu County, Jeollabuk-do**:  
  - Ranked among the lowest in physician, hospital, and bed availability  
  - Highest unmet medical needs rate nationwide

- **Nationwide Specialty Imbalance**:  
  - Nearly all regions fail to meet the ideal essential specialty ratio

### Jangsu County – Regional Characteristics

- Declining population (21,336 in 2022 to 20,732 in 2024)
- High aging rate (38.3%, double the national average)
- Mountainous terrain, physically isolated
- High extinction risk index (ranked 21st nationwide)

## 5. Policy Recommendations

| Approach     | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Telemedicine (Online)** | Pilot remote healthcare services in Jangsu, with central government funding and technical support. Integrate telemedicine with public health centers and enable remote prescriptions and medicine delivery. |
| **Mobile Clinics (Offline)** | Institutionalize and stabilize the "Visiting Doctor Bus" initiative to provide in-person care in remote rural areas. Address budgetary and effectiveness concerns through formalized regulation. |

## 6. International Case Studies

- **Japan**: Early adoption of telemedicine in the 1970s; expanded during COVID-19; minimal misdiagnosis issues reported in 2022
- **Finland**: Virtual hospitals since 2017 using digital health platforms
- **Australia**: Legal framework for telehealth; expanded access post-COVID
